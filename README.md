It is essential that the different controllable appliances be interconnected and 
communicate with each other. The basic aim of Home automation is to control or 
monitor signals from different appliances, or basic services. A smart phone or web 
browser can be used to control or monitor the home automation system. 
We are using many sensors to make home automation like DHT11 for measuring the 
temperature, Ultrasonic sensor for measuring the level of water tank of water, Flame 
Sensor for detecting the fire or smoke inside the home, soil sensor for detecting the 
soil moisture into the soil, Rain sensor for whenever the rain will come it will sends 
the message to the Thingsboard because we are using esp32 a Wi-Fi module which 
help in maintaining the data of these sensors online for us.
